# ✅ Todo Application (Part 2)

This is the **second version** of my Todo Application.  
The first version was built using **HTML and JavaScript** with only the basic add-task functionality.  

In this updated version, I have made some improvements:  
- 🎨 Added **CSS styling** for a better and clean UI  
- 🗑️ Added a **Delete button** to remove tasks easily  
- 🆕 Created this as a **new repository** instead of updating the old one, because I wanted it to feel like a fresh start
